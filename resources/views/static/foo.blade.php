                        The terms foobar, or foo and bar are used as placeholder names (also referred to as metasyntactic variables) in computer programming or computer-related documentation. They have been used to name entities such as variables, functions, and commands whose exact identity is unimportant and serve only to demonstrate a concept.

                    <p>
                        The etymology of foo is obscure. Its use in connection with bar is generally traced to the World War II military slang <strong>FUBAR ({{ $abbv }})</strong>, later bowdlerised to foobar. The word foo on its own was used earlier. The use of foo in a programming context is generally credited to the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) of MIT from circa 1960. However, the precise relationship of these terms is not known with certainty, and several anecdotal theories have been advanced to identify them.
